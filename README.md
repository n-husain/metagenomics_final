# metagenomics_final
This repository is a collection of scripts and files used for Practical Introduction to Metagenomics

# File Structure
Within this file you'll find numerous files that were required for Practical Introduction to Metagenomics Final @ JHU

  csv_files [ collection of initial samples collected and outputted using FR-HIT]
  frp_hexagon.py [python file for Hexagon plot]
  frp_hexagon.ipyb [ipython file for Hexagon plot]
  frp_scatter.ipyb [ipython file for scatter plot]
  frp_scatter.py [python file for scatter plot]
  final_genome.csv [data that was used, but is too large for github. we will have it linked below]
  bacterial_data.csv [combined data that was used, but is too large for github. we will have it linked below]
  small.csv [test data that was used and contains only one genome, but is too large for github. we will have it linked below]
  
# Working with Plot.ly
for any of the frp_scatter.* files, one would need to create an account with plot.ly and get input the user's unique username and API Key. To obtain your key/username sign up at https://plot.ly/Auth/login/?next=%2Fsettings. You will be given a username. Go to into the settings and on the left pane you will see API Keys, click it. After clicking API Keys a API Settings will come put with your username and a box, which says "(Re)generate Key" click it and now you have your API Key. Please take this username and API key and input it into the frp_scatterplot.* codebase.

# Best Practice
We created this project using Google's Colabaratory. As such, much of the code base is used to work in tandem with Colabatory and we HIGHLY reccomend the *.ipyb files. 

# Best Practice
Genomic data notoriously creates large files. As such please see the link for the data we used for the project below:
