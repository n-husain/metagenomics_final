# Novel Methods for Visualizing Fragment Recruitment Plots
This repository is a collection of scripts and files used for Practical Introduction to Metagenomics

# File Structure
Within this file you'll find numerous files that were required for Practical Introduction to Metagenomics Final @ JHU

* csv_files - *collection of initial samples collected and outputted using FR-HIT*
* frp_hexagon.py- *python file for Hexagon plot*
* frp_hexagon.ipyb- *ipython file for Hexagon plot*
* frp_scatter.ipyb- *ipython file for scatter plot*
* frp_scatter.py- *python file for scatter plot*
* final_genome.csv- *data that was used, but is too large for github. linked below*
* bacterial_data.csv- *combined data that was used, but is too large for github. linked below*
* small.csv- *test data that was used and contains only one genome, but is too large for github. linked below*
  
# Working with Plot.ly
for any of the frp_scatter.* files, one would need to create an account with plot.ly and obtain a unique username and API Key. 
1. To obtain your key/username sign up at https://plot.ly/Auth/login/?next=%2Fsettings. 
2. You will be given a username. 
3. Go to into the settings and on the left pane you will see API Keys, click it. 
4. After clicking API Keys an API Settings will come with your username and a box, which says "(Re)generate Key," click it
5. Now you have your API Key.
6. Input this username and API key and into the frp_scatterplot.* codebase.

# Best Practice
We created this project using Google's Colabaratory. As such, much of the code base is used to work in tandem with Colabatory and we HIGHLY reccomend the *.ipyb files. 

# Genomic Data
Genomic data notoriously creates large files. As such please see the link for the data we used for the project below:
